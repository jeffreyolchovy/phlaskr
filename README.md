Phlaskr
=======

Phlaskr is a PHP port of the Flask project's microblog example, Flaskr.


Why?
----

I threw this small example together after the latest wave of PHP hate hit the internet. 

I currently default to using Flask when I have to put up a front-end focused web project, but I've also used PHP pretty extensively for doing things like this in the past.

They both can get the job done. I just enjoy writing in Python more than I do PHP at this point.

That's not to say that one is better than the other.


But is one *better* than the other?
-------------------------------

Who cares.
